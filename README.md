# My VIM setup

## Installation

NOTE: This will move your existing .vimrc to .vimrc.bak and create a new .vimrc

ALSO NOTE: This assumes your default Vim is available from the `vi` command. If this is not the case, run `:BundelInstall` inside vim after installing.

```sh
bash < <(curl -Ls https://github.com/jeffdeville/my.vim/raw/master/scripts/setup.sh)
```
